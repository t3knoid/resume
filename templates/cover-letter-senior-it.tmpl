Dear [Hiring Manager’s Name],

I am excited to apply for the Senior IT position at [Company Name]. My experience in IT operations, infrastructure management, and automation aligns well with the requirements of this position.

Throughout my career, I have developed and maintained critical IT systems, leading automation initiatives that streamlined identity management, account provisioning, and system integrations. My expertise includes infrastructure-as-code solutions, scripting in Python and Bash, and managing CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and TeamCity. Additionally, I have overseen authentication systems, administered virtual environments across Windows, Linux, and macOS, and led troubleshooting efforts to ensure seamless IT operations.

Beyond technical proficiency, I focus on continuous improvement, leveraging industry best practices and collaborating across teams to enhance IT workflows. My experience mentoring team members and optimizing security and automation supports Duolingo’s mission to maintain a robust and scalable IT environment.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with [Company Name]’s needs.

Sincerely,
Francis Refol
